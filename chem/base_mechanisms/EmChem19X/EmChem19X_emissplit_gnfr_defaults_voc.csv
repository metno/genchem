# VOC splits for GNFR (19 sectors) and EmChem19a+EmChem19X -- Robert & Dave Jan-Jun 2020
# Merges CAMS 25-compounds (v01, v02...) with matrix to get emep compounds
# created by mkEC19emissplitMCM.py, mkNMVOCsplit.py etc.
# from TNO CAMS71_REF2_v1_2015/CAMS71-II_scenarios_v1_REF2_2015
# Nov 2019 moved trace amounts of apinene to 50%  C2H4 and 50% unreactive. 
# Nov 2019 moved trace amounts of isoprene to C2H4.
# May 2021. Copied L AgriOther to K AgriLivestock (11) and M Other (13)
