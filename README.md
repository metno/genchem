GenChem 
=======

This package contains the GenChem system, which 
includes a chemical pre-processor (**GenChem.py**) for converting chemical
equations into differential form for use in atmospheric chemical transport
models (CTMs).  Although primarily intended for users of the **EMEP MSC-W**
chemical transport model (https://github.com/metno/emep-ctm) and 
related systems, GenChem also features a simple box-model testing system
(**boxChem**), which can run as a stand-alone chemical solver, enabling for
example easy testing of chemical mechanisms against each other.

Updates:

  2023-12: Converted system to use CloudJ photolysis, c.f. van Caspel et al. (2023):

    https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-16-7433-2023

    By default, all chemical mechanisms employ photolysis rates based
    on MCM in boxChem. However, when "use_cloudj = T" is set in the config 
    namelist file, (clear-sky) photolysis rates calculated using the Cloud-J v7.3e 
    photolysis code are used instead. The EMEP model can only use Cloud-J from v4.51 onward, 
    using the Briegleb averaging cloud effect scheme by default. 

    To reflect the CloudJ update, in addition to a few minor changes, the default
    chemical mechanism has been updated to EmChem19c (c for cloudj). The changes include
    specified background concentration for CH4 and H2, and the inclusion of three 
    explicit glyoxal photolysis channels. 

  2022-12-21: Added EmChem19X, and updated READMEs to refer to NEW report:

  2022-06-14: Revised tag: 1.1
  2022-06-13: Added -g --gnfr flags to enable GNFR emissplits, and renamed files, e.g. emissplit_snap_defaults_voc.csv

  2020-12-21: GMD article published! Link above updated 

  2020-10-22: GMD article accepted for publication. 

  2020-09-03:
    Bug fix: changed log to log10 in Shorthands file for CB6r2Em
    changed group name of PANs to PANS in Species file
    Moved chem/scripts/GenIn_Shorthands.txt to chem/generic_Shorthands.txt
     to make this file more visible.
    Added -i, -v args to getboxconcs.py in box/scripts
