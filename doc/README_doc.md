GenChem documentation directory
------------------------------

To look at documentation, do::

   firefox  _build/html/index.html

or::

   evince _build/latex/GenChemDoc.pdf


This documentation is written in restructured text (rst), and processed
with sphinx to make the html files in the UsersGuide directory ('make html'
from this directory. If pdf is wanted, type 'make latexpdf', and look
in the build directory).
