The GenChem system was created over many years:

  David Simpson, Norwegian Meteorological Institute & Chalmers, 
  1998-2020: wrote original GenChem.pl scripts, the
  boxChem system, assorted helper scripts (do.GenChem, boxplots.py, etc.), 
  and python3 conversion.

  Alan Briolat, Stockholm Environment Institute at York,  2013: wrote the
  first python version: GenChem.py.

  Hannah Imhof, Chalmers,  2016: added extra flexibility and types
  of arrays (e.g. factor groups), plus further scripts.  Added
  CRI and MCM chemical mechanisms.

  John Johansson, Chalmers, 2017-2020: worked with and improved many scripts
  from the GenChem system.

  Robert Bergstr√∂m, Chalmers and SMHI, 2017-2020: development of
  chemical mechanisms (e.g. EmChem19a family, VBS schemes) for gas and aerosols.

  Alvaro Valdebenito, Norwegian Meteorological Institute, 2018-2019,
  various bug-fixes and updates. Added pollen.

  Michael Priestley, Univ. Gothenburg, 2020. Added Docker system and
  testing for Windows PCs.

  Willem van Caspel, Norwegian Meteorological Institute, 2023,
  small changes to EmChem19a (now EmChem19c), and introduction of CloudJ photolysis.
